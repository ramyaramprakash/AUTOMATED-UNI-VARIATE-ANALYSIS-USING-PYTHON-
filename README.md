# AUTOMATED-UNI-VARIATE-ANALYSIS-USING-PYTHON-
Exploratory Data Analysis is a lengthy process and we have tried to automate it by creating a function in Python that takes data frame, column number or column name(optional, if not specified takes all the columns in the data frame) and directory(optional, if not specified uses current working directory) as the arguments from the user and creates histogram and boxplots for numerical columns and bar chart(for different categories along with frequency) for qualitative columns. Each graph is given a unique name based on the column name and it also stores the graphs as image files in the specified directory.
